# wto_data_puller
This repository is dedicated to simplifying the process for pulling data from the WTO's public api.

14/02/2020: Currently awaiting an API key from the WTO before I can begin developing this package. <br>
15/02/2020: Created a script that executes a API query and outputs a JSON file. <br>
23/02/2020: Updated the library package to contain all queries available in the WTO manual. <br>
Also created a CSV save option for timeseries datapoint queries. The default datafiles produced are still JSON files. 
21/03/2020: Created two new shortcut functions [get_json_data() & get_csv_data()]. Implemented some imporovements in the package structure to hopefully make this package callable.
